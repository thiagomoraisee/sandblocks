Sandblocks is a collection of microelectronic IPs designed for technology exploration and methodology validation in digital design. Each block is modular and self-contained, building a portfolio for seamless integration into ASIC projects.

The main goal of this project is to develop robust, synthesizable microelectronic IP blocks while testing architectural approaches for PPA efficiency, developing auxiliary tools, and exploring configurations for ASIC flows. As a FOSS enthusiast, I'll primarily use (but am not limited to) open-source projects and tools such as [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/), [SystemC](https://systemc.org/), and the [SkyWater](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/) PDK. Commercial tools from Cadence and Synopsys may also be used along this journey, as they are industry leaders in the microelectronics field.

Each IP block in this project is designed to be fully self-contained, with a clear and modular structure to facilitate ease of integration and reuse. Each block includes comprehensive documentation, testbenches, and configuration files. This design approach ensures that each IP can function independently, simplifying the process of incorporating it into different projects or testing environments.
